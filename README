Step 1 - You cannot have the multilingual characters in unicode document.. convert the document to UTF-8 document
advanced editors don't make it simple for you... go low level... 
use notepad to save the document as meName.html & change the encoding
type to UTF-8
Step 2 - Mention in your html page that you are going to use such characters by
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">
Step 3 - When you put in some characters make sure your container tags have the following 2 properties set
dir='rtl'
lang='ar'
Step 4 - Get the characters from some specific tool\editor or online editor like i did with Arabic-Keyboard.org
example

<p dir="rtl" lang="ar" style="color:#e0e0e0;font-size:20px;">رَبٍّ زِدْنٍي عِلمًا</p>
